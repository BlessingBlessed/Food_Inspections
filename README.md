## Tourist Guide to finding Low Risk Restuarants in Chicago to eat.

Being a food and hodophilee,or simply Epicurista! I’m always excited about visiting new places and enjoying great food and wine everywhere around the world.
Finding a low risk restaurants has always been important to me, due to food sensitivities and intolerances, as a result I have a  very sensitve stomach.
The aim of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis on the Food Inspectionn data set from the city of Chicago data portal.
